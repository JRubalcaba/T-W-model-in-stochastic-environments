## T-W-model-in-stochastic-environments

#### J. Rubalcaba, J.P. Veiga, V. Polo (in prep)


Our aim is to analyse the consequences of stochasticity on offspring condition and fitness in a polygamous and 
sexually dimorphic species in which males are bigger than females. We defined the model as a two-steps process 
in which (a) parents determine body size of their sons and daughters during the period of parental care; and 
(b) body size determine the fitness return of males and females. Stochasticity is defined here as the 
spatial variability affecting individuals independently. This variability is included in the system in two forms. 
First, individuals could individually optimize resource investment relying on environmental or physiological cues, 
e.g., in relation to their body condition, age or breeding experience and territory quality (rm and rf). 
Second, parents investing a given amount of resources could obtain a variability of results when unpredictable 
environmental factors affect their breeding activities. This variability represents the uncertainty of parents 
determining body condition and fitness of their offspring (Îµ).
